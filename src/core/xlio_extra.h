 * Socket isolation option groups sockets under specified policy.
 *
 * Supported policies:
 *   - SO_XLIO_ISOLATE_DEFAULT - default behavior according to XLIO configuration.
 *
 *   - SO_XLIO_ISOLATE_SAFE - isolate sockets from the default sockets and guarantee thread
 *     safety regardless of XLIO configuration (note: this option doesn't change socket API
 *     thread safety model). This policy is mostly effective in XLIO_TCP_CTL_THREAD=delegate
 *     configuration.
 *
 * Current limitations:
 *   - SO_XLIO_ISOLATE option is supported only by TCP sockets
 *   - SO_XLIO_ISOLATE must be called according to thread safety model and XLIO configuration
 *   - SO_XLIO_ISOLATE may be called after socket() syscall and before either listen() or connect()
