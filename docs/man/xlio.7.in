.B libxlio.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B XLIO
XLIO boosts the performance of applications written over standard socket API
such as web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming,
and more. Reduction of latency, increasing throughput and effective CPU utilization
is achieved by full network stack bypass and direct access to accelerated
network hardware.
XLIO dynamically links with these applications at run-time, redirect standard
socket API calls allowing them to be accelerated without modification.
