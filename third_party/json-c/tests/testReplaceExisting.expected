==== delete-in-loop test starting ====
Key at index 0 is [foo1] 0 (kept)
Key at index 1 is [foo2] 0 (kept)
Key at index 2 is [deleteme] 0 (deleted)
Key at index 3 is [foo3] 0 (kept)
==== replace-value first loop starting ====
Key at index 0 is [foo1] 0
Key at index 1 is [foo2] 0
replacing value for key [foo2]
Key at index 2 is [foo3] 0
==== second loop starting ====
Key at index 0 is [foo1] 0
Key at index 1 is [foo2] 0
pointer for key [foo2] does match
Key at index 2 is [foo3] 0
