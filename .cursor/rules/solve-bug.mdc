Build a comprehensive fix plan for a bug that has already been evaluated using `@evaluate-bug.mdc`. This workflow focuses on proposing solutions and creating an implementation plan.

## Prerequisites
**Stop and ask user to install Redmine MCP if unavailable.**

**IMPORTANT: This workflow assumes you have already run `@evaluate-bug.mdc` for this ticket.**

If evaluate-bug has not been run:
1. Run `@evaluate-bug.mdc [ticket#]` first to complete investigation and root cause analysis
2. Review the evaluation results before proceeding
3. Only proceed with solve-bug once you understand the root cause

**Required inputs from evaluate-bug:**
- Ticket analysis summary
- Root cause identification
- Bug flow diagrams
- Affected components list

If ticket number is not provided, request it from the user.

## Phase 1: Solution Proposals

Propose **2-3 viable solutions**, each with:

### Solution [N]: [Brief Title]
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the approach
- **Changes required**: Files/functions to modify
- **Pros**: Advantages of this approach
- **Cons**: Disadvantages or limitations
- **Complexity**: Low/Medium/High
- **Risks**: Potential breaking changes or side effects
- **Testing approach**: How to verify this fix

## Phase 2: Recommendation

### Recommended Solution: [Title]
**Rationale**: Explain why this solution is best, comparing trade-offs:
- Best balance of simplicity vs. robustness
- Minimizes risk and scope of change
- Aligns with codebase patterns
- Most maintainable long-term

**Implementation Steps**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests to add/modify
- Integration test scenarios
- Manual verification steps

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Potential side effects and how to handle them
- Rollback strategy if issues arise
- Monitoring/validation after deployment

## Notes
- If evaluation information is insufficient, clearly state what's missing and ask user
- Validate all assumptions by examining actual code
- Consider both quick fixes and proper long-term solutions
- Think about regression prevention
