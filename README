Introduction
============

Accelerated IO SW library (XLIO) boosts the performance of applications written over standard socket API such as
web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. Reduction of latency, increasing
throughput and effective CPU utilization is achieved by full network stack bypass and direct access to
accelerated network hardware.
XLIO dynamically links with these applications at run-time, redirect standard socket API calls allowing them to be
be accelerated without modification.

Build library from source
========================

Prerequisites:
1. rdma-core upstream kernel and userspace verbs libraries (libibverbs, libmlx4, libmlx5, librdmacm)
2. Autoconf, Automake, libtool, unzip, patch, libnl-devel (netlink 1 or 3)

Build:
1. ./autogen.sh
2. ./configure --prefix=/usr
3. make
4. sudo make install


Install library from rpm or debian
=================================

Installing:
Install the package as any other rpm or debian package [rpm -i libxlio.X.Y.Z-R.rpm].
The installation copies the XLIO library to: /usr/lib[64]/libxlio.so
The XLIO monitoring utility is installed at: /usr/bin/xlio_stats
The XLIO extra socket API is located at: /usr/include/mellanox/xlio_extra.h

Upgrading:
Use rpm update procedure: # rpm -U libxlio.X.Y.Z-R.rpm
You can upgrade by uninstalling (rpm -e) the previously installed package
before starting to install the new library rpm.

Uninstalling:
When uninstalling remember to uninstall (rpm -e) the package before you
uninstall ofed.

Running:
Set the environment variable LD_PRELOAD to libxlio.so and run your application.
Example: # LD_PRELOAD=libxlio.so iperf -uc 224.22.22.22 -t 5



Configuration Values
====================

On default startup the XLIO library logs to stderr the version, the modified
configuration parameters being used and their values.
Please notice that except XLIO_TRACELEVEL, library logs just those parameters whose value != default.

 XLIO INFO   : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

XLIO_TRACELEVEL
Logging level the library will be using. Default is info
Example: # XLIO_TRACELEVEL=debug

none
    Print no log at all
panic
    Panic level logging, this would generally cause fatal behavior and an exception
    will be thrown by the library. Typically, this is caused by memory
    allocation problems. This level is rarely used.
error
    Runtime ERRORs in the library.
    Typically, these can provide insight for the developer of wrong internal
    logic like: Errors from underlying OS or Infiniband verbs calls. internal
    double mapping/unmapping of objects.
warn
    Runtime warning that do not disrupt the workflow of the application but
    might warn of a problem in the setup or the overall setup configuration.
    Typically, these can be address resolution failure (due to wrong routing
    setup configuration), corrupted ip packets in the receive path or
    unsupported functions requested by the user application
info
    General information passed to the user of the application. Bring up
    configuration logging or some general info to help the user better
    use the library
details
    Complete XLIO's configuration information.
    Very high level insight of some of the critical decisions done in library.
debug
    High level insight to the operations done in the library. All socket API calls
    are logged and internal high level control channels log there activity.
fine
    Low level run time logging of activity. This logging level includes basic
    Tx and Rx logging in the fast path and it will lower application
    performance. It is recommended to use this level with XLIO_LOG_FILE parameter.
finer
    Very low level run time logging of activity!
    This logging level will DRASTICALLY lower application performance.
    It is recommended to use this level with XLIO_LOG_FILE parameter.
all
    today this level is identical to finer

XLIO_LOG_DETAILS
Add details on each log line.
0 = Basic log line
1 = ThreadId
2 = ProcessId + ThreadId
3 = Time + ProcessId + ThreadId [Time is in milli-seconds from start of process]
Default value is 0

XLIO_LOG_COLORS
Use color scheme when logging. Red for errors, purple for warnings and dim for
low level debugs. XLIO_LOG_COLORS is automatically disabled when logging is direct
to a non terminal device (e.g. XLIO_LOG_FILE is configured).
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

XLIO_LOG_FILE
Redirect all logging to a specific user defined file.
This is very useful when raising the XLIO_TRACELEVEL
Library will replace a single '%d' appearing in the log file name with the pid of
the process loaded with XLIO. This can help in running multiple instances of XLIO
each with it's own log file name.
Example:  XLIO_LOG_FILE=/tmp/xlio_log.txt

XLIO_SPEC
XLIO predefined specification profiles.

latency
    Optimized for use cases that are keen on latency.
    Example: XLIO_SPEC=latency

ultra-latency
    Optimized for use cases that are keen on latency even more. This mode uses
    singe threaded model, avoid OS polling and progress engine.
    Example: XLIO_SPEC=ultra-latency

nginx
    Optimized for nginx. This profile must be used to offload nginx. This profile
    is turned indirectly by setting:
    XLIO_NGINX_WORKERS_NUM=<N> where N is the number of nginx workers.

nginx_dpu
    Optimized for nginx running inside NVIDIA DPU.
    Example: XLIO_SPEC=nginx_dpu XLIO_NGINX_WORKERS_NUM=<N>

nvme_bf3
    Optimized for SPDK solution over NVIDIA DPU BF3
    Example: XLIO_SPEC=nvme_bf3

XLIO_STATS_FILE
Redirect socket statistics to a specific user defined file.
Library will dump each socket's statistics into a file when closing the socket.
Example:  XLIO_STATS_FILE=/tmp/stats

XLIO_STATS_SHMEM_DIR
Set the directory path for the library to create the shared memory files for xlio_stats.
No files will be created when setting this value to empty string "".
Default value is /tmp/

XLIO_SERVICE_NOTIFY_DIR
Set the directory path for XLIO to write files used by xliod.
Default value is /tmp/xlio/
Note: when used xliod must be run with --notify-dir directing the same folder.

XLIO_STATS_FD_NUM
Max number of sockets monitored by XLIO statistic mechanism.
Value range is 0 to 1024.
Default value is 100

The number of QP's can change according to the number of network offloaded
interfaces.
Default value is 32768

XLIO_TX_WRE_BATCHING
The number of Tx Work Request Elements used until a completion signal is requested.
Tuning this parameter allows a better control of the jitter encountered from the
Tx CQE handling. Setting a high batching value results in high PPS and lower
average latency. Setting a low batching value results in lower latency std-dev.
Value range is 1-64
Default value is 64

XLIO_TX_MAX_INLINE
Max send inline data set for QP.
Data copied into the INLINE space is at least 32 bytes of headers and
the rest can be user datagram payload.
XLIO_TX_MAX_INLINE=0 disables INLINEing on the Tx transmit path.
In older releases this parameter was called: XLIO_MAX_INLINE
Default XLIO_TX_MAX_INLINE is 204

XLIO_TX_MC_LOOPBACK
This parameter sets the initial value used by XLIO internally to controls the
multicast loopback packets behavior during transmission.
An application that calls setsockopt() with IP_MULTICAST_LOOP will run over
the initial value set by this parameter.
Read more in 'Multicast loopback behavior' in notes section below
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

XLIO_TX_NONBLOCKED_EAGAINS
Return value 'OK' on all send operation done on a non-blocked UDP sockets. This
is the OS default behavior. The datagram sent is silently dropped inside XLIO
or the network stack.
When set Enabled (set to 1), the library will return with error EAGAIN if it was unable
accomplish the send operation and the datagram was dropped.
In both cases a dropped Tx statistical counter is incremented.
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_TX_PREFETCH_BYTES
Accelerate offloaded send operation by optimizing cache. Different values
give optimized send rate on different machines. We recommend you tune this
for your specific hardware.

The number of TCP segments fetched from the segments pool by a ring at once.
Min value is 1
Default value is 1024

XLIO_RING_ALLOCATION_LOGIC_TX
XLIO_RING_ALLOCATION_LOGIC_RX
Ring allocation logic is used to separate the traffic to different rings.
By default all sockets use the same ring for both RX and TX over the same interface.
Even when specifying the logic to be per socket or thread, for different interfaces
we use different rings. This is useful when tuning for a multi-threaded application
and aiming for HW resource separation.
Warning: This feature might hurt performance for applications which their main
processing loop is based in select() and/or poll().
The logic options are:
0  - Ring per interface
1  - Ring per ip address (using ip address)
10 - Ring per socket (using socket fd as separator)
20 - Ring per thread (using the id of the thread in which the socket was created)
30 - Ring per core (using cpu id)
31 - Ring per core - attach threads : attach each thread to a cpu core
Default value is 20

XLIO_RING_MIGRATION_RATIO_TX
XLIO_RING_MIGRATION_RATIO_RX
Ring migration ratio is used with the "ring per thread" logic in order to decide when
it is beneficial to replace the socket's ring with the ring allocated for the current thread.
Each XLIO_RING_MIGRATION_RATIO iterations (of accessing the ring) we check the current
thread ID and see if our ring is matching the current thread.
If not, we consider ring migration. If we keep accessing the ring from the same thread for some
iterations, we migrate the socket to this thread ring.
Use a value of -1 in order to disable migration.
Default value is -1

XLIO_RING_LIMIT_PER_INTERFACE
Limit the number of rings that can be allocated per interface.
For example, in ring allocation per socket logic, if the number of sockets using
the same interface is larger than the limit, then several sockets will be sharing the
same ring.
Use a value of 0 for unlimited number of rings.
Default value is 0 (no limit)

XLIO_RING_DEV_MEM_TX
XLIO can use the On Device Memory to store the egress packet if it does not fit into
the BF inline buffer. This improves application egress latency by reducing PCI transactions.
Using XLIO_RING_DEV_MEM_TX, the user can set the amount of On Device Memory buffer allocated
for each TX ring.
The total size of the On Device Memory is limited to 256k for a single port HCA and to
128k for dual port HCA.
Default value is 0

XLIO_RX_BUF_SIZE
Size of Rx data buffer elements allocation.
Can not be less then MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) and greater than 0xFF00.
Default value is calculated basing on maximum MTU.

XLIO_RX_WRE
Number of Work Request Elements allocated in all RQs.
Default value is 128 for XLIO_STRQ=1 (default) or 32768 for XLIO_STRQ=0.

XLIO_RX_WRE_BATCHING
Number of Work Request Elements and RX buffers to batch before recycling.
Batching decrease latency mean, but might increase latency STD.
Value range is 1-1024.
Default value is 1024

XLIO_RX_BYTES_MIN
Minimum value in bytes that will be used per socket by XLIO when applications
call to setsockopt(SO_RCVBUF). If application tries to set a smaller value then
configured in XLIO_RX_BYTES_MIN, XLIO will force this minimum limit value on the
socket.XLIO offloaded socket's receive max limit of ready bytes count. If the
application does not drain a sockets and the byte limit is reached, new
received datagrams will be dropped.
Monitor of the applications socket's usage of current, max and dropped bytes
and packet counters can be done with xlio_stats.
Default value is 65536

XLIO_RX_POLL
The number of times to poll on Rx path for ready packets before going to sleep
(wait for interrupt in blocked mode) or return -1 (in non-blocked mode).
This Rx polling is done when the application is working with direct blocked
calls to read(), recv(), recvfrom() & recvmsg().
When Rx path has successful poll hits (see performance monitoring) the latency
is improved dramatically. This comes on account of CPU utilization.
Value range is -1, 0 to 100,000,000
Where value of -1 is used for infinite polling
Default value is 100000

XLIO_TSO
With Segmentation Offload, or TCP Large Send, TCP can pass a buffer to be
transmitted that is bigger than the maximum transmission unit (MTU) supported
by the medium. Intelligent adapters implement large sends by using the
prototype TCP and IP headers of the incoming send buffer to carve out segments
of required size. Copying the prototype header and options, then calculating
the sequence number and checksum fields creates TCP segment headers.
Expected benefits: Throughput increase and CPU unload.
Default value: auto

auto
    Depends on ethtool setting and adapter ability.
    See ethtool -k <eth0> | grep tcp-segmentation-offload
on
    Enabled in case adapter supports it
off
    Disabled

kTLS API. Refer to your TLS library documentation for kTLS support information.
When this parameter is enabled, XLIO offloads TLS RX path if possible.
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_UTLS_TX
When this parameter is enabled, XLIO offloads TLS TX path through kTLS API if
possible. See XLIO_UTLS_RX for details.
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

XLIO_LRO
Large receive offload (LRO) is a technique for increasing inbound throughput of
high-bandwidth network connections by reducing central processing unit (CPU)
overhead. It works by aggregating multiple incoming packets from a single stream
into a larger buffer before they are passed higher up the networking stack,
thus reducing the number of packets that must be processed.
Default value: auto

auto
    Depends on ethtool setting and adapter ability.
    See ethtool -k <eth0> | grep large-receive-offload
on
    Enabled in case adapter supports it
off
    Disabled

XLIO_RX_POLL_INIT
XLIO maps all UDP sockets as potential offloaded capable. Only after the
ADD_MEMBERSHIP does the offload start to work and the CQ polling kicks in XLIO.
This parameter control the polling count during this transition phase where the
socket is a UDP unicast socket and no multicast addresses where added to it.
Once the first ADD_MEMBERSHIP is called the above XLIO_RX_POLL takes effect.
Value range is similar to the above XLIO_RX_POLL
Default value is 0

XLIO_RX_UDP_POLL_OS_RATIO
The above parameter will define the ratio between XLIO CQ poll and OS FD poll.
This will result in a single poll of the not-offloaded sockets every

Default value is 0

XLIO_HW_TS_CONVERSION
The above parameter defines the time stamp conversion method.
The value of XLIO_HW_TS_CONVERSION is determined by all devices - i.e if the hardware of
one device does not support the conversion, then it will be disabled for the other devices.
Options = [0,1,2,3,4,5]:
0 = Disabled
1 = Raw-HW time                           - only convert the time stamp to seconds.nano_seconds time
                                            units (or disable if hardware does not supports).
2 = Best possible - Raw-HW or system time - Sync to system time, then Raw hardware time -
                                            disable if none of them are supported by hardware.
3 = Sync to system time                   - convert the time stamp to seconds.nano_seconds time units.
                                            comparable to receive software timestamp.
                                            disable if hardware does not supports.
4 = PTP Sync                              - convert the time stamp to seconds.nano_seconds time units.

                                            if hardware does not supports).
5 = RTC Sync                              - convert the time stamp to seconds.nano_seconds time units.
                                            in case it is not supported - will apply option 3 (or disable
                                            if hardware does not supports).
Default value: 3

XLIO_RX_POLL_YIELD
When an application is running with multiple threads, on a limited number of
cores, there is a need for each thread polling inside the XLIO (read, readv,
recv & recvfrom) to yield the CPU to other polling thread so not to starve
them from processing incoming packets.
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_RX_PREFETCH_BYTES
Size of receive buffer to prefetch into cache while processing ingress packets.
The default is a single cache line of 64 bytes which should be at least 32
bytes to cover the IP+UDP headers and a small part of the users payload.
Increasing this can help improve performance for larger user payload sizes.
Value range is 32 bytes to MTU size
Default value is 256 bytes

XLIO_RX_PREFETCH_BYTES_BEFORE_POLL
Same as the above XLIO_RX_PREFETCH_BYTES, only that prefetch is done before
actually getting the packets.
This benefit low pps traffic latency.
Disable with 0.
Default value is 0

XLIO_RX_CQ_DRAIN_RATE_NSEC
Socket's receive path CQ drain logic rate control.
When disabled (Default) the socket's receive path will first try to return a
ready packet from the socket's receive ready packet queue. Only if that queue
is empty will the socket check the CQ for ready completions for processing.
When enabled, even if the socket's receive ready packet queue is not empty it
will still check the CQ for ready completions for processing. This CQ polling
rate is controls in nano-second resolution to prevent CPU consumption because
of over CQ polling. This will enable a more 'real time' monitoring of the
sockets ready packet queue.
Recommended value is 100-5000 (nsec)
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_TCP_ABORT_ON_CLOSE
This parameter controls how XLIO performs socket close operation. If enabled,
XLIO sends RST segment and discards TCP state for the socket. Notice, in this
scenario pending data segments may be unsent.
If disabled, XLIO sends pending data segments and then FIN segment.
Default: 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_RX_POLL_ON_TX_TCP
This parameter enables/disables TCP RX polling during TCP TX operation for faster
TCP ACK reception.
Default: 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_TRIGGER_DUMMY_SEND_GETSOCKNAME
This parameter triggers dummy packet send from getsockname(), this
will warm up the caches.
For more information regarding dummy send, see XLIO user manual document.
Default: 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_SKIP_POLL_IN_RX

XLIO_GRO_STREAMS_MAX
Control the number of TCP streams to perform GRO (generic receive offload) simultaneously.
Disable GRO with a value of 0.
Default value is 32

XLIO_TCP_2T_RULES
Use only 2 tuple rules for TCP connections, instead of using 5 tuple rules.
This can help to overcome steering limitations for outgoing TCP connections.
However, this option requires a unique local IP address per XLIO ring. In
the default ring per thread configuration, this means that each thread must
bind its sockets to a thread local IP address.
Default: 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_TCP_3T_RULES
Use only 3 tuple rules for incoming TCP connections, instead of using 5 tuple
rules. This can improve performance for a server with listen socket which
accepts many connections.
Outgoing TCP connections that are established with connect() syscall aren't
affected by this option.
Default: 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_UDP_3T_RULES
This parameter can be relevant in case application uses connected udp sockets.
3 tuple rules are used in hardware flow steering rule when the parameter is enabled and
5 tuple flow steering rule when it is disabled.
Enabling this option can reduce hardware flow steering resources.
But when it is disabled application might see benefits in latency and cycles per packet.
Default: 1 (Enabled)

XLIO_ETH_MC_L2_ONLY_RULES
Use only L2 rules for Ethernet Multicast.
All loopback traffic will be handled by XLIO instead of OS.

a packet arrives.
Default: 32768

XLIO_SELECT_POLL
The duration in micro-seconds (usec) in which to poll the hardware on Rx path before
going to sleep (pending an interrupt blocking on OS select(), poll() or epoll_wait().
The max polling duration will be limited by the timeout the user is using when
calling select(), poll() or epoll_wait().
When select(), poll() or epoll_wait() path has successful receive poll hits
(see performance monitoring) the latency is improved dramatically. This comes
on account of CPU utilization.
Value range is -1, 0 to 100,000,000
Where value of -1 is used for infinite polling
Where value of 0 is used for no polling (interrupt driven)
Default value is 100000

XLIO_SELECT_POLL_OS_FORCE
This flag forces to poll the OS file descriptors while user thread calls
select(), poll() or epoll_wait() even when no offloaded sockets are mapped.
Enabling this flag causes XLIO to set XLIO_SELECT_POLL_OS_RATIO and
XLIO_SELECT_SKIP_OS to 1. This will result in XLIO_SELECT_POLL number of
times XLIO will poll the OS file descriptors, along side with offloaded
sockets, if such sockets exists.
Note that setting XLIO_SELECT_SKIP_OS and XLIO_SELECT_POLL_OS_RATIO
directly will override the values these parameters gets while
XLIO_SELECT_POLL_OS_FORCE is enabled.
Enable with 1
Disable with 0
Default value is 0

XLIO_SELECT_POLL_OS_RATIO
This will enable polling of the OS file descriptors while user thread calls
select() or poll() and the XLIO is busy in the offloaded sockets polling loop.
This will result in a single poll of the not-offloaded sockets every
XLIO_SELECT_POLL_RATIO offloaded sockets (CQ) polls.
When disabled, only offloaded sockets are polled.
(See XLIO_SELECT_POLL for more info)
Disable with 0
Default value is 10

XLIO_SELECT_SKIP_OS
For select() or poll() this will force XLIO to check the non offloaded fd even
though an offloaded socket has ready packets found while polling.
Default value is 4

XLIO_PROGRESS_ENGINE_INTERVAL
XLIO Internal thread safe check that the CQ is drained at least once
every N milliseconds.
This mechanism allows the library to progress the TCP stack even when the application
doesn't access its socket (so it doesn't provide a context to XLIO).
If CQ was already drained by the application receive
socket API calls then this thread goes back to sleep without any processing.
Disable with 0
Default value is 10 msec

XLIO_PROGRESS_ENGINE_WCE_MAX
Each time XLIO's internal thread starts it's CQ draining, it will stop when
reach this max value.
The application is not limited by this value in the number of CQ elements
it can ProcessId form calling any of the receive path socket APIs.
Default value is 10000

XLIO_CQ_POLL_BATCH_MAX
Max size of the array while polling the CQs in the XLIO
Default value is 16

XLIO_CQ_KEEP_QP_FULL
If disabled (default), CQ will not try to compensate for each poll on the
receive path. It will use a "debt" to remember how many WRE miss from each QP
to fill it when buffers become available.
If enabled, CQ will try to compensate QP for each polled receive completion. If
buffers are short it will re-post a recently completed buffer. This causes a packet
drop and will be monitored in the xlio_stats.
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

XLIO_QP_COMPENSATION_LEVEL
Number of spare receive buffer CQ holds to allow for filling up QP while full
receive buffers are being processes inside XLIO.
Default value is XLIO_RX_WRE / 2

Default value is 100 (milliseconds)

XLIO_TCP_CTL_THREAD
Select which TCP control flows are done in the internal thread.
This feature should be kept disabled if using blocking poll/select (epoll is OK).
Use value of 'disable' to disable.
Use value of 'delegate' to handle TCP timers in application context threads.
  In this mode the socket must be handled by the same thread from the time of its creation
  to the time of its destruction. Otherwise, it may lead to an unexpected behaviour.
Use value of 'with_wakeup' for waking up the thread when there is work to do.
Use value of 'no_wakeup' for waiting for thread timer to expire.
Default value is disabled

XLIO_TCP_TIMESTAMP_OPTION
If set, enable TCP timestamp option.
Currently, LWIP is not supporting RTTM and PAWS mechanisms.
See RFC1323 for info.
Use value of 0 to disable.
Use value of 1 for enable.
Use value of 2 for OS follow up.
Disabled by default (enabling causing a slight performance degradation).

Useful for quickly identifying XLIO unsupported Socket API or features
Use value of -2 to exit() on XLIO startup failure.
Use value of -1 for just handling at DEBUG severity.
Use value of 0 to log DEBUG message and try recovering via Kernel network stack (un-offloading the socket).
Use value of 1 to log ERROR message and try recovering via Kernel network stack (un-offloading the socket).
Use value of 2 to log ERROR message and return API respectful error code.
Use value of 3 to log ERROR message and abort application (throw xlio_error exception).
Default value is -1 (notice, that in the future the default value will be changed to 0)

XLIO_AVOID_SYS_CALLS_ON_TCP_FD
For TCP fd, avoid system calls for the supported options of:
ioctl, fcntl, getsockopt, setsockopt.
Non-supported options will go to OS.
To activate, use XLIO_AVOID_SYS_CALLS_ON_TCP_FD=1.
Default value is disabled

XLIO_INTERNAL_THREAD_AFFINITY
Control which CPU core(s) the XLIO internal thread is serviced on. The cpu set
should be provided as *EITHER* a hexadecimal value that represents a bitmask. *OR* as a
comma delimited of values (ranges are ok). Both the bitmask and comma delimited list
methods are identical to what is supported by the taskset command. See the man page

Select a cpuset for XLIO internal thread (see man page of cpuset).
The value is the path to the cpuset (for example: /dev/cpuset/my_set), or an empty
string to run it on the same cpuset the process runs on.
Default value is an empty string.

XLIO_INTERNAL_THREAD_ARM_CQ
Wakeup the internal thread for each packet that the CQ receive.
Poll and process the packet and bring it to the socket layer.
This can minimize latency in case of a busy application which is not available to
receive the packet when it arrived.
However, this might decrease performance in case of high pps rate application.
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_WAIT_AFTER_JOIN_MSEC
This parameter indicates the time of delay the first packet send after
receiving the multicast JOINED event from the SM
This is helpful to over come loss of first few packets of an outgoing stream
due to SM lengthy handling of MFT configuration on the switch chips
Default value is 0 (milliseconds)

XLIO_BUFFER_BATCHING_MODE

Default value is 2 (Huge pages)

XLIO_MEMORY_LIMIT
Pre-allocated memory limit for buffers. Note that the limit doesn't include
dynamic memory allocation and XLIO memory consumption can exceed the limit.
Default value is 2GB

The following XLIO neigh parameters are for advanced users or internal support only:

XLIO_MEMORY_LIMIT_USER
Memory limit for external user allocator. The user allocator can optionally be
provided with XLIO extra API. Default value 0 makes XLIO use XLIO_MEMORY_LIMIT
value for user allocations.
Default value is 0

XLIO_HUGEPAGE_SIZE
Force specific hugepage size for XLIO internal memory allocations. Value 0 allows
to use any supported and available hugepages. The size may be specified with
suffixes such as KB, MB, GB.
Default value is 0

XLIO_NEIGH_UC_ARP_QUATA
XLIO will send UC ARP in case neigh state is NUD_STALE.
In case that neigh state is still NUD_STALE XLIO will try
XLIO_NEIGH_UC_ARP_QUATA retries to send UC ARP again and then will send BC ARP.

XLIO_NEIGH_UC_ARP_DELAY_MSEC
This parameter indicates number of msec to wait between every UC ARP.

XLIO_NEIGH_NUM_ERR_RETRIES
This number indicates number of retries to restart neigh state machine in case neigh got ERROR event.
Default value is 1

XLIO_FORK
Control whether XLIO should support fork. Setting this flag on will cause XLIO to
call ibv_fork_init() function. ibv_fork_init() initializes libibverbs's data
structures to handle fork() function calls correctly and avoid data corruption.
If ibv_fork_init() is not called or returns a non-zero status, then libibverbs
data structures are not fork()-safe and the effect of an application calling
fork() is undefined.
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

XLIO_CLOSE_ON_DUP2
When this parameter is enabled, XLIO will handle the duplicate fd (oldfd),
as if it was closed (clear internal data structures) and only then,
will forward the call to the OS.
This is, in practice, a very rudimentary dup2 support.
It only supports the case, where dup2 is used to close file descriptors,
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

XLIO_SOCKETXTREME
When this parameter is enabled, XLIO operates in SocketXtreme mode.
SocketXtreme mode brings latency down, eliminating copy operations and
increasing throughput allowing applications to further utilize true kernel
bypass architecture. An application should use a socket extension API named SocketXtreme.
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

XLIO_MTU
Size of each Rx and Tx data buffer (Maximum Transfer Unit).
This value sets the fragmentation size of the packets sent by the library.
If XLIO_MTU is 0 then for each interface XLIO will follow the actual MTU.
If XLIO_MTU is greater than 0 then this MTU value is applicable to all
interfaces regardless of their actual MTU
Default value is 0 (following interface actual MTU)

XLIO_MSS
XLIO_MSS define the max TCP payload size that can sent without IP fragmentation.
Value of 0 will set XLIO's TCP MSS to be aligned with XLIO_MTU configuration
(leaving 40 bytes room for IP + TCP headers; "TCP MSS = XLIO_MTU - 40").
Other XLIO_MSS values will force XLIO's TCP MSS to that specific value.
Default value is 0 (following XLIO_MTU)

XLIO_TCP_CC_ALGO
TCP congestion control algorithm.
The default algorithm coming with LWIP is a variation of Reno/New-Reno.
The new Cubic algorithm was adapted from FreeBSD implementation.
Use value of 0 for LWIP algorithm.
Use value of 1 for Cubic algorithm.
Use value of 2 in order to disable the congestion algorithm.
Default value is 0 (LWIP).

XLIO_TCP_SEND_BUFFER_SIZE
TCP send buffer size of LWIP.
Default value is 1MB.

XLIO_ZC_TX_SIZE
Determines the maximum segment size for zero copy buffers.
Maximum value is 65535.
Default value is 32KB.

XLIO_TCP_MAX_SYN_RATE
Limit the number of TCP SYN packets that XLIO will handle
per second per listen socket.
For example, in case you use 10 for this value than XLIO will accept at most 10
(could be less) new connections per second per listen socket.
Use a value of 0 for un-limiting the number of TCP SYN packets that can be handled.
Value range is 0 to 100000.
Default value is 0 (no limit)

XLIO_MULTILOCK
Control locking type mechanism for some specific flows.
Note that usage of Mutex might increase latency.
0 - Spin
1 - Mutex
Default: 0 (Spin)

XLIO_PRINT_REPORT
Print a human readable report of resources usage at exit. The report is printed
during termination phase. Therefore, It can be missed if the process is killed
with the SIGKILL signal.
Default: 0 (Disabled)

XLIO Monitoring & Performance Counters
=====================================
The XLIO internal performance counters include information per user
sockets and a global view on select() and epoll_wait() usage by the application.

Use the 'xlio_stats' included utility to view the per socket information and
performance counters during run time.
Usage:
        xlio_stats [-p pid] [-k directory] [-v view] [-d details] [-i interval]

Defaults:
        find_pid=enabled, directory="/tmp/", view=1, details=1, interval=1,

Options:
  -p, --pid=<pid>               Show XLIO statistics for process with pid: <pid>
  -k, --directory=<directory>   Set shared memory directory path to <directory>
  -n, --name=<application>      Show XLIO statistics for application: <application>
  -f, --find_pid                Find and show statistics for XLIO instance running (default)
  -F, --forbid_clean            By setting this flag inactive shared objects would not be removed
  -i, --interval=<n>            Print report every <n> seconds
  -c, --cycles=<n>              Do <n> report print cycles and exit, use 0 value for infinite (default)
  -v, --view=<1|2|3|4|5>        Set view type:1- basic info,2- extra info,3- full info,4- mc groups,5- similar to 'netstat -tunaep'
  -d, --details=<1|2>           Set details mode:1- to see totals,2- to see deltas
  -z, --zero                    Zero counters
  -l, --log_level=<level>       Set XLIO log level to <level>(1 <= level <= 7)
  -S, --fd_dump=<fd> [<level>]  Dump statistics for fd number <fd> using log level <level>. use 0 value for all open fds
  -D, --details_level=<level>   Set XLIO log details level to <level>(0 <= level <= 3)
  -s, --sockets=<list|range>    Log only sockets that match <list> or <range>, format: 4-16 or 1,9 (or combination)
  -V, --version                 Print version
  -h, --help                    Print this help message


Use XLIO_STATS_FILE to get internal XLIO statistics like xlio_stats provide.
If this parameter is set and the user application performed transmit or receive
activity on a socket, then these values will be logs once the sockets are closed.

Below is a logout example of a socket performance counters.
Below the logout example there is some explanations about the numbers.

XLIO: [fd=10] Tx Offload: 455 KB / 233020 / 0 / 3 [bytes/packets/drops/errors]
XLIO: [fd=10] Tx OS info:   0 KB /      0 / 0 [bytes/packets/errors]
XLIO: [fd=10] Rx Offload: 455 KB / 233020 / 0 / 0 [bytes/packets/eagains/errors]
XLIO: [fd=10] Rx byte: max 200 / dropped 0 (0.00%) / limit 2000000
XLIO: [fd=10] Rx pkt : max 1 / dropped 0 (0.00%)
XLIO: [fd=10] Rx OS info:   0 KB /      0 / 0 [bytes/packets/errors]
XLIO: [fd=10] Rx poll: 0 / 233020 (100.00%) [miss/hit]

Looking good :)
- No errors on transmit or receive on this socket (user fd=10)
- All the traffic was offloaded. No packets transmitted or receive via the OS.
- Just about no missed Rx polls (see XLIO_RX_POLL & XLIO_SELECT_POLL), meaning
 the receiving thread did not get to a blocked state to cause a contexts
 switch and hurt latency.
- No dropped packets caused by socket receive buffer limit (see XLIO_RX_BYTES_MIN)

Interrupt Moderation
====================
The basic idea behind interrupt moderation is that the HW will not generate
interrupt for each packet, but instead only after some amount of packets received
or after the packet was held for some time.

The adaptive interrupt moderation change this packet count and time period
automatically to reach a desired rate of interrupts.


1. Use XLIO_RX_POLL=0 and XLIO_SELECT_POLL=0 to work in interrupt driven mode.

2. Control the period and frame count parameters with:
    XLIO_CQ_MODERATION_COUNT - hold #count frames before interrupt
    XLIO_CQ_MODERATION_PERIOD_USEC - hold #usec before interrupt

3. Control the adaptive algorithm with the following:
    XLIO_CQ_AIM_MAX_COUNT - max possible #count frames to hold
    XLIO_CQ_AIM_MAX_PERIOD_USEC - max possible #usec to hold
    XLIO_CQ_AIM_INTERRUPTS_RATE_PER_SEC - desired interrupt rate
    XLIO_CQ_AIM_INTERVAL_MSEC - frequency of adaptation

4. Disable CQ moderation with XLIO_CQ_MODERATION_ENABLE=0
5. Disable Adaptive CQ moderation with XLIO_CQ_AIM_INTERVAL_MSEC=0

 XLIO_WARNING: * Offloaded resources are restricted to root or user with CAP_NET_RAW privileges
 XLIO_WARNING: * Read the CAP_NET_RAW and root access section in the XLIO's User Manual for more information
 XLIO_WARNING: ******************************************************************************

This warning message means that XLIO tried to create a hardware QP resource
while the kernel requires this operation to be performed only by privileged
users. Run as user root or grant CAP_NET_RAW privileges to your user

* Huge pages out of resource:

 XLIO WARNING: ************************************************************
 XLIO WARNING: NO IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED!
 XLIO WARNING: Not enough suitable hugepages to allocate 2097152 kB.
 XLIO WARNING: Allocation will be done with regular pages.
 XLIO WARNING: To avoid this message, either increase number of hugepages
 XLIO WARNING: or switch to a different memory allocation type:
 XLIO WARNING:   XLIO_MEM_ALLOC_TYPE=ANON
 XLIO INFO   : Hugepages info:
 XLIO INFO   :   1048576 kB : total=0 free=0
 XLIO INFO   :   2048 kB : total=0 free=0
 XLIO WARNING: ************************************************************

This warning message means that you are using XLIO with hugepages memory allocation,
but not enough huge pages resources are available in the system.
If you want XLIO to take full advantage of the performance benefits of huge pages then
you should restart the application after adding more hugepages resources in your
system or trying to free unused hupepages shared memory segments with the below script.

NOTE: Use 'ipcs -m' and 'ipcrm -m shmid' to check and clean unused shared memory segments.
Below is a short script to help you release XLIO unused huge pages resources:
    for shmid in `ipcs -m | grep 0x00000000 | awk '{print $2}'`;
    do echo 'Clearing' $shmid; ipcrm -m $shmid;
    done;

* Not supported Bonding Configuration:

 XLIO WARNING: ******************************************************************************
 XLIO WARNING: XLIO doesn't support current bonding configuration of bond0.
 XLIO WARNING: The only supported bonding mode is "802.3ad(#4)" or "active-backup(#1)"
 XLIO WARNING: with "fail_over_mac=1" or "fail_over_mac=0".
 XLIO WARNING: The effect of working in unsupported bonding mode is undefined.
 XLIO WARNING: Read more about Bonding in the XLIO's User Manual
 XLIO WARNING: ******************************************************************************

This warning message means that XLIO has detected bonding device which is configured
to work in mode which is not supported by XLIO, this means that XLIO will not support
high availability events for that interface.
XLIO currently supports just active-backup(#1) or 802.3ad(#4) and fail_over_mac = 1 or 0 mode.
In order to fix this issue please change the bonding configuration.

Example:

Lets assume that the bonding device is bond0, which has two slaves: ib0 and
ib1.

Shut down the bond0 interface:
#ifconfig bond0 down

Find all the slaves of bond0:
#cat sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
ib0 ib1

Free all the slaves:
#echo -ib0 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
#echo -ib1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves

Change the bond mode:
#echo active-backup > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/mode

Change the fail_over_mac mode:
#echo 1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/fail_over_mac

Enslave the interfaces back:
#echo +ib0 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
#echo +ib1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves

Bring up the bonding interface:
#ifconfig bond0 up
OR
#ifconfig bond0 <ip> netmask <netmask> up

* Not supported Bonding & VLAN Configuration:

 XLIO WARNING: ******************************************************************
 XLIO WARNING: bond0.10: vlan over bond while fail_over_mac=1 is not offloaded
 XLIO WARNING: ******************************************************************

This warning message means that XLIO has detected bonding device which is configured with
VLAN over it while fail_over_mac=1.
This means that the bond will not be offloaded.
In order to fix this issue please change the bonding configuration.
